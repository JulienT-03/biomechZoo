# biomechZoo toolbox

biomechZoo is a user-customizable toolbox for the processing, analysis, and visualization of biomechanical movement data. 

## Getting started: 
- Download this repository (click on green button 'Clone or download' on the right of the repository page)
- Start Matlab 
- Open and run 'startZoo.m' located in the root biomechZoo folder to set your Matlab path

## User guide:
Directory tree and function descriptions can be found at:
https://phild001.github.io/biomechZoo-help/

### Prerequisites

Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA) v2017b or newer software running, at minimum, the following toolboxes:
- Signal processing and Statistics
- Deep Learning 
- Statistics and Machine Learning
 
Older Matlab versions are not supported. 

## Summary:
Movement data often contain variables recorded over time, for many subjects, groups, or conditions. The biomechZoo toolbox provides tools to help users achieve sort, process, statistically analyze, and visualize these data. 

## Audience: 
biomechZoo can help those new to programming / biomechanics to quickly process their data by providing a framework from which to create a streamlined processing workflow. Advanced users are encouraged to contribute to the biomechZoo project by providing additional functions. 

## Help: 
Help for biomechZoo can be accessed via the biomechZoo-help repository (https://github.com/PhilD001/biomechZoo-help). This repository provides exercises, sample data, and other resources to help the user get started with biomechZoo. Additional help may be obtained via seminars (see website for announcements) or
by contacting the main author. 

## Additional information

The biomechZoo toolbox, was tested on Mac (OSX 10.11.5, Matlab v2016b),  Windows 10 Enterprise (Matlab 2015a and 2016a), and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) platforms.

## Get involved

The biomechZoo toolbox is in constant development. We are working to improve functionality and user experience with every version. 
Users interested in getting involved should contact the main developper. We are currently interested in the following development streams: 
- Improvements to the director 3D environment
- Development of a python-based version of biomechZoo 
- Addition of analysis tools for specialized analyses
